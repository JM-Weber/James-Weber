[Back to Home](./)

During my PhD I taught a range of courses and supervised several researct students. 

- 1<sup>st</sup> year Chemistry - Molecular Structure, Kinetics, Thermodynamics, Organic & Inorganic Chemistry
I supervised 8 undergraduates from Pembroke College for the whole Part IA Chemistry course during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years.

- 3<sup>rd</sup> year Atmospheric Chemistry - Introduction to Stratospheric and Tropospheric Chemistry
I supervised 5 undergraduates during the 2018-19 academic year.

- 4<sup>th</sup>  year Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Change - Interdisciplinary Course
I supervised 6 undergraduates during the 2019-20 academic year.

- 1<sup>st</sup> year Laboratory Demonstrator
I demonstrated for 9 undergraduates during the 2018-2019 academic year in the Part IA practical course including marking experimental reports.

- 4<sup>th</sup> year MSci Supervisor - Atmospheric Chemistry
I supervised 2 Part III MSci projects in Atmospheric Chemistry looking at:
  * Using observations from aircraft to evaluate chemical mechanisms and machine learning approaches. 
  * Comparing modelled O3 changes from the COVID19 pandemic to observations.
