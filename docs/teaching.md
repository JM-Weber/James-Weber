# Teaching

[Back to Home](./)

During my PhD I taught a range of courses and supervised several research students. 

## Undergraduate Teaching
- **1<sup>st</sup> year Chemistry** - Molecular Structure, Kinetics, Thermodynamics, Organic & Inorganic Chemistry <br /> I supervised 8 undergraduates from Pembroke College for the whole Part IA Chemistry course during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years.

- **3<sup>rd</sup> year Atmospheric Chemistry** - Introduction to Stratospheric and Tropospheric Chemistry
<br /> I supervised 5 undergraduates during the 2018-19 academic year.

- **4<sup>th</sup>  year Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Change** - Interdisciplinary Course
<br /> I supervised 6 undergraduates during the 2019-20 academic year.

- **1<sup>st</sup> year Laboratory Demonstrator**
<br /> I demonstrated for 9 undergraduates during the 2018-2019 academic year in the Part IA practical course including marking experimental reports.

## Postgraduate Teaching
- **4<sup>th</sup> year MSci Supervisor - Atmospheric Chemistry**<br /> 
I supervised 2 Part III MSci projects in Atmospheric Chemistry looking at:
    * Using observations from aircraft to evaluate chemical mechanisms and machine learning approaches. 
    * Comparing modelled O<sub>3</sub> changes from the COVID19 pandemic to observations.
    
- **MPhil Assistant Supervisor - Atmospheric Cehemistry**<br /> 
Deeveloping and evaluating an improved scheme for DMS chemistry in UKCA.

- **UKCA Climate Model Training Course 2021, 2022<br />**
I demonstrated on the 2021 and 2022 UKCA training courses (link [here](https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA_Chemistry_and_Aerosol_Tutorials_at_vn11.8)) run by Dr N. Luke Abraham. This demonstrating role involved helping students with the course's exercises and explaining aspects of the model.  

## University Bridging Courses
I have extensive experience (c. 700 hours) teaching Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics at sixth form-level and have written several short courses on Chemistry and Mathematics topics which bridge the gap between sixth form and University-level study. These are designed to make the transition easier for students and are available to all incoming Natural Scientists at Pembroke. An example can be seen [here](https://oxbridge-science-academy.github.io.).
