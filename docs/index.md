# Dr James Weber
### Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Atmospheric Radiation, Composition and Climate

### University of Reading


I am an atmospheric chemist and climate scientist and hold a lectureship in Atmospheric Radiation, Composition and Climate at the University of Reading. My academic background is in modelling the gas phase chemical reactions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by vegetation and their effect on climate.

I am most interested in how the chemical composition of our atmosphere is changing, how this will affect climate and the influence of various climate change mitigation strategies such as tree planting. My most recent research has focused on the non-CO<sub>2</sub> climate impacts of wide scale tree planting as a climate change mitigation strategy. I use data from the state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models [UKESM](https://ukesm.ac.uk) (United Kingdom Earth System Model) and [CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu) (Community Earth System Model) to explore how changes to forest cover could affect atmospheric composition and climate.

Before my lectureship, I was a post doctoral research aassociate in Dr Maria Val Martin's group at Sheffield and did my PhD with Professor Alex Archibald at the University of Cambridge. 

I attended the Seventeenth Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists, [ACCESS XVII](https://www.bnl.gov/accesscolloquium), at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
