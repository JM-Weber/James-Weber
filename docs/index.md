### About

I am an atmospheric chemist working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Sheffield. My current focuses on the non-CO<sub>2</sub> climate impacts of wide scale tree planting as climate change mitigation strategy.

I use the state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model UKESM (United Kingdom Earth System Model) to explore 

I am also an associate of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation ([LC<sup>3</sup>M](https://lc3m.org)).
