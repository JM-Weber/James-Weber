### Postdoctoral Research Associate, Climate Change Mitigation
### University of Sheffield


I am an atmospheric chemist and climate scientist working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Sheffield. My academic background is in modelling the gas phase chemical reactions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by vegetation and their effect on climate.

I am most interested in how the chemical composition of our atmosphere is changing and how this will affect climate. My current research focuses on the non-CO<sub>2</sub> climate impacts of wide scale tree planting as a climate change mitigation strategy. I use data from the state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models [UKESM](https://ukesm.ac.uk) (United Kingdom Earth System Model) and [CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu) (Community Earth System Model) to explore how changes to forest cover could affect atmospheric composition and climate. Read more [here](./research.md). 

I am part of Dr Maria Val Martin's group at Sheffield and also an associate of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation ([LC<sup>3</sup>M](https://lc3m.org)). 

I have been selected to attend the Seventeenth Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists,[ACCESS XVII](https://www.bnl.gov/accesscolloquium), at Brookhaven National Laboratory as one of 25 attendees from 90 applicants.
