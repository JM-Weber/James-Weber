# Dr James Weber
### Postdoctoral Research Associate, Climate Change Mitigation
### University of Sheffield



I am an atmospheric chemist and climate scientist working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Sheffield. My academic background is in modelling the chemical reactions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by vegetation in the atmosphere and their effect on climate and my current research focuses on the non-CO<sub>2</sub> climate impacts of wide scale tree planting as climate change mitigation strategy. I use the state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models UKESM (United Kingdom Earth System Model) and CESM (Community Earth System Model) to explore how changes to tree cover could affect atmospheric composition and the effects on climate.

I am also an associate of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation ([LC<sup>3</sup>M](https://lc3m.org)).
