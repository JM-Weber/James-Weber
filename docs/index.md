I am an atmospheric chemist and climate scientist working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Sheffield. My academic background is in modelling the gas phase chemical reactions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by vegetation and their effect on climate.

I am most interested in how the chemical composition of our atmosphere is changing and how this will affect climate. My current research focuses on the non-CO<sub>2</sub> climate impacts of wide scale tree planting as a climate change mitigation strategy. I use the state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models [UKESM](https://ukesm.ac.uk) (United Kingdom Earth System Model) and [CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu) (Community Earth System Model) to explore how changes to tree cover could affect atmospheric composition and climate. Read more [here](./research.md). 

I am part of Dr Maria Val Martin's group at Sheffield and also an associate of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation ([LC<sup>3</sup>M](https://lc3m.org)).
