# My Work with UKESM

[Back to Home](./)

### Overview
The United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM) is a global chemistry-climate model. UKESM simulates all aspects of the Earth System including the atmosphere, the land surface, the ocean and the cryosphere and the interactions between these components. UKESM was one of the major climate models which contributed to the 6<sup>th</sup> Coupled Model Intercomparison project (CMIP6) which contrinbuted to the evidence base of the IPCC 6<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report in 2021 (AR6). A detailed description of UKESM can be found [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019MS001739). 

### My Experience with UKESM

I have extensive experience running simulations in UKESM including  


### My contributions to UKESM

#### CRI-Strat 2
As an atmospheric chemist I am primarily interested in processes which determine atmospheric composition. These are simulated in the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA) module of UKESM. During my PhD I led work to add and evaluate an improved chemistry mechanism called CRI-Strat 2 (CS2) in UKCA which features some of the most recent updates to isoprene chemistry with knock-on effects for oxidant concentrations and aerosol (paper [here](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/5239/2021/)). CS2 is now a selectable option in UKESM. 

#### Secondary Organic Aerosol from Isoprene
During my PhD I improved the coupling between BVOCs and aerosol by updating the aerosol code in UKESM to allow for production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from isoprene in addition to its default production from monoterpenes. This significantly improves the faithfulness of SOA production, particularly in its spatial variation given that monoterpenes are emitted to a greater extent by mid and high latitude forests while isoprene emissions occurs to a much greater extent in the tropics.

#### Isoprene and Monoterpenes Emission Factors 
UKESM simulates isoprene and monoterpene emissions interactively, combining temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, photosynthetic activity and the propensity of different types of  vegetation (grasses, evergreen trees, deciduous trees etc.) to emit these species. The latter is described by the vegetation's emission factor and I am currently working on developing a new set of emission factors which will improve the simulation of BVOC emission. This will be particularly important for modelling future climate scenarios as changes to the land use and land cover (e.g. deforesation for agriculuture) are likely to have significant impacts on BVOC emissions.
