[Back to Home](./)

The United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM) is a global chemistry-climate model. UKESM simulates all aspects of the Earth System including the atmosphere, the land surface, the ocean and the cryosphere and the interactions between these components. UKESM was one of the major climate models which contributed to the 6<sup>th</sup> Coupled Model Intercomparison project (CMIP6) which contrinbuted to the evidence base of the IPCC 6<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report in 2021 (AR6). A detailed description of UKESM can be found [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019MS001739).
