# The Long View

[Back to Home](./)

This page is more of a blog post of my thoughts about the key challenges in atmospheric chemistry and its role in climate science. It is by no means exhaustive or even correct, rather opinions of mine formed after discussion with colleagues and reviews of the literature.

I believe there are 3 key questions at the intersection of atmospheric composition and climate.

#### 1. How will (non-CO<sub>2</sub>) atmospheric composition change over the course of this century under different societal development scenarios?  





#### 2. What role will this change in atmospheric composition affect have on climate? Will this change exacerbate or oppose CO<sub>2</sub> driven warming?   






#### 3. How will the changing atmospheric composition influence the effectiveness of climate change mitigation strategies such as re/afforestation or marine cloud brightening?
