# The Long View

[Back to Home](./)

This page is more of a blog post of my thoughts about the key challenges in atmospheric chemistry and its role in climate science. It is by no means exhaustive or even correct, rather opinions of mine formed after discussion with colleagues and reviews of the literature.

Climate change is primarily driven by increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and without a doubt reducing emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and ultimately CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is critical to averting severe climate change. 

However, changes to the concentrations of other gases and aerosol will also play an important role in future climate and our efforts to prevent severe climate change since these species are often much more efficient per unit mass as climate forcers. 

In my view, four of the key questions at the intersection of atmospheric composition and climate are: 

#### 1. How will (non-CO<sub>2</sub>) atmospheric composition change over the course of this century under different societal development scenarios?  



#### 2. What role will this change in atmospheric composition have have on climate? In other words, will these changes exacerbate or oppose CO<sub>2</sub>-driven warming?   



#### 3. How will proposed climate change mitigation strategies, such as a wide scale tree planting or marine cloud brightening, change atmospheric composition and climate? 



#### 4. What role will atmospheric composition play in the effectiveness of climate change mitigation strategies?
