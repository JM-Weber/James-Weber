# Supervising

[Back to Home](./)


- **SURE Undergraduate Rseeach Student - The effect of the Clean Air Zone in Sheffield**<br /> 
I submitted a research proposal and recieved Â£1250 to fund an undergradaute research project for 6 weeks over summer 2023 as part of the University of Sheffield's [SURE](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/sure2023/home) scheme facilitating undergraduate research. The project aism to assess the impact of the [Clean Air Zone](https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/campaigns/clean-air-zone-sheffield) introduced by SHeffield City Coundil on 27<sup>th<\sup> February 2023 by applying statistical techniques to air quality measuremenst across the city.    

- **4<sup>th</sup> year MSci Supervisor - Atmospheric Chemistry**<br /> 
I supervised 2 Part III MSci projects in Atmospheric Chemistry looking at:
    * Using observations from aircraft to evaluate chemical mechanisms and machine learning approaches (2019-2020). - Seb Hickman (now PhD student at Cambridge)
    * Comparing modelled O<sub>3</sub> changes from the COVID19 pandemic to observations (2020-2021). - Shengxian Ke 
    
- **MPhil Assistant Supervisor - Atmospheric Chemistry**<br /> 
Developing and evaluating an improved scheme for DMS chemistry in UKCA (2020-2021). - Ben Cala (now PhD student at NIOZ), paper in review in ACP [link](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2023-42/). 

- **MSc Supervisor - Atmospheric Chemistry**<br /> 
I generated model data for a student and advised them on analysis techniques to investigate how tree planting may affect surface air quality.
