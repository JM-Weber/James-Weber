# Research

[Back to Home](./)

I am interested in the chemical composition of the atmosphere, how it is changing and the role this will play in future climate change. I am also interested in interaction between atmospheric composition and climate change mitigation solutions - how will these solutions affect atmospheric composition (could there be unintended consequences?) and, flipped around, how might the atmosperic composition infleunce how the effectiveness of these solutions?
