# Research

[Back to Home](./)

I am interested in the chemical composition of the atmosphere, how it is changing and the role this will play in future climate change. I am also interested in interaction between atmospheric composition and climate change mitigation solutions - how will these solutions affect atmospheric composition (could there be unintended consequences?) and, flipped around, how might the composition of the atmosphere influence the effectiveness of these solutions? 


My current research interests involve the climatic effect of two widely proposed climate change mitigation solutions - tree planting and enhanced rock weathering (ERW) - via their impact on atmospheric composotition. 

### Tree Planting ###



### ERW ###
ERW via the applicaton of ground basalt to cropland reduces the emissions of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>)O) from agricultural soils. N<sub>2</sub>)O is a potent greenhouse gas (c. 300x stronger than CO<sub>2</sub>) but  also plays an important role in stratospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration. Stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> is vital to life as it reduces the amount of high frequency harmful radiation which reaches the Earth's surface. The effect of sustained reductions to N<sub>2</sub>O emissions remain uncertain as N<sub>2</sub>O acts as a source of NO<sub>x</sub>(= NO + NO<sub>2</sub>) which destroys O<sub>3</sub> directly but also reacts with other O<sub>3</sub>-destroying molecules such as ClO, locking them up in reservoir species (e.g. ClONO<sub>2</sub>) which don't destroy O<sub>3</sub>. These competeing process   will vary in importance over time as the stratospheric burden of chlorinated species falls (due to the Montreal Protocol banning their emission) k up the deceline while other factors such as straopsorhci temperature (controlled by and so the determine the effect of such N2O emission reductions, transient simulations whcih pci
