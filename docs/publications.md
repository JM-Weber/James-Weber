#### 1. [Improvements to the representation of BVOC chemistry–climate interactions in UKCA (v11.5) with the CRI-Strat 2 mechanism: incorporation and evaluation (Geoscientific Model Development, 2021)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/5239/2021/).

This paper presents the incoporation and evaluation of the CRI-Strat 2 (CS2) chemistry scheme in UKCA. We compare model performance using CS2 with other mechanisms in UKCA against observational datasets and, through sensitivity tests, isolate the impact of the changes to the chemistry of isoprene, O(<sup>1</sup>D), inorganic nitrogen and RO<sub>2</sub>+NO reactions.


#### 2. [CRI-HOM: A novel chemical mechanism for simulating highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) in global chemistry–aerosol–climate models. (Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 2020)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/20/10889/2020)

We present one of the first schemes to describe the chemistry of highly oxygenated organic molcules (HOMs) formation from monoterpenes suitable for use in global climate models. HOMs are important as they can participate in aerosol nucleation, including without sulphuric acid.


#### 3. [Minimal climate impacts from short‐lived climate forcers following emission reductions related to the COVID‐19 pandemic (Geophysical Review Letters, 2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020GL090326)

In UKESM we simulate emission reductions similar to those from the COVID19 pandemic and find that changes in short lived climate forcers such as SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and black carbon aerosol have a minimal impact on climate.


#### 4. [Chemistry-driven changes strongly influence climate forcing from vegetation emissions. (Nature Communications)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34944-9)

In UKESM we show that the climate response to a doubling of BVOCs depends strongly on the chemical mechanism used. When state-of-the-art chemistry is employed, the lower depletion of oxidants means positive radiative forcing from methane increases and CDNC decreases is greatly diminished.



#### 5. [Updates to Isoprene and Terpene Emission Factors for the Interactive BVOC Emission Scheme (iBVOC) in the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/3083/2023/)

This paper aims to improve the emission factors of isoprene and monterpenes for the 13 plant fucntional types in UKESM. We show how these changes lead to be more realistic chanegs to emissions under major land cover change scenarios.
