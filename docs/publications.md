### Improvements to the representation of BVOC chemistryâ€“climate interactions in UKCA (v11.5) with the CRI-Strat 2 mechanism: incorporation and evaluation (Geoscientific Model Development; 2021)
This paper presents the incoporation and evaluation of the CRI-Strat 2 (CS2) chemistry scheme in UKCA. We compare model performance using CS2 with other mechanisms in UKCA against observational datasets and, through sensitivity tests, isolate the impact of the changes to the chemistry of isoprene, O(<sup>1</sup> D), inorganic nitrogen and RO<sub>2</sub>+NO reactions. The paper can be viewed [here](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/5239/2021/).
