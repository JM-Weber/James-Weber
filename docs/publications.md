#### Improvements to the representation of BVOC chemistry–climate interactions in UKCA (v11.5) with the CRI-Strat 2 mechanism: incorporation and evaluation (Geoscientific Model Development, 2021)

This paper presents the incoporation and evaluation of the CRI-Strat 2 (CS2) chemistry scheme in UKCA. We compare model performance using CS2 with other mechanisms in UKCA against observational datasets and, through sensitivity tests, isolate the impact of the changes to the chemistry of isoprene, O(<sup>1</sup> D), inorganic nitrogen and RO<sub>2</sub>+NO reactions.

#### CRI-HOM: A novel chemical mechanism for simulating highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) in global chemistry–aerosol–climate models. (Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 2020)

This paper presents one of the first schemes to describe the chemistry of highly oxygenated organic molcules (HOMs) from monoterpenes, suitable for use in global climate models. View [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/20/10889/2020)
